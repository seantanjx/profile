  "about": "I am a final year undergraduate from Singapore Management University, and I enjoy building products using what I have learnt in computer science. \n\nIn my free time, I love to explore and play around with new technologies and so my recent endeavour was a DIY smart home system to integrate automations to my smart home devices.\n\nI am a HUGE (I mean HUGGE) coffee lover! I make my own traditional Nanyang Coffee at home, and I'll always go for Kopi C Siu Dai at any time of the day. So hit me up if you have any traditional coffee/cafe recommendations!\n\nI also love watching dramas - Chinese Wuxia/Historical, American Sitcoms, Korean Romcoms, and there are my top 5 drama recommendations:",
